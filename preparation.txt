Architecture & Design
Why did you choose FastAPI over Flask/Django? What are the performance benefits?
Why Cassandra as your database? What advantages does it provide for this use case vs PostgreSQL/MongoDB?
How does your hybrid ML + rule-based prediction system work? Why not pure ML?
What's your frontend state management strategy? (Redux setup, data flow)
How do you handle real-time updates between frontend and backend?

Machine Learning
Why Random Forest over other algorithms (neural networks, gradient boosting, logistic regression)?
What features does your model use? How did you select them?
What's your model accuracy and how did you validate it? (cross-validation, test set performance)
How do you handle class imbalance (pass vs fail rates)?
How often do you retrain the model? What's your retraining pipeline?
How do you prevent overfitting with limited student data?
What's the confidence threshold for showing ML predictions vs fallback to rules?

Data & Performance
How do you handle missing or incomplete student data?
What's your API response time for prediction requests?
How did you optimize batch predictions? (I see BATCH_OPTIMIZATION.md)
How do you handle concurrent users? What's your scalability plan?
What's your data preprocessing pipeline? How do you clean/transform the data?

Security & Authentication
How do you secure student data? (JWT implementation, encryption at rest)
What's your authentication flow? How do you prevent unauthorized access?
How do you handle CORS in production vs development?
How do you protect against common vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, etc.)?

Testing & Quality
What's your test coverage? (I see test files - what do they validate?)
How do you test ML model predictions? Unit tests vs integration tests?
How do you ensure data quality from CSV imports?

Business Logic
How do you model prerequisite chains? What happens with circular dependencies?
How do you handle different program variants (202301-normal, etc.)?
What's your elective recommendation algorithm? How do you rank them?
How do you calculate subject difficulty metrics? Is it static or dynamic?
How do you handle credit transfers or exemptions?

Deployment & DevOps
What's your deployment strategy? (Docker? Cloud platform?)
How do you monitor system health in production?
What's your backup and disaster recovery plan for student data?
How do you handle database migrations when schema changes?

Future Enhancements
What would you improve with more time?
How would you scale this to thousands of students?
What other ML models or features would you add?
How would you integrate with actual university systems?

Critical Technical Deep-Dives
Walk me through a prediction request - from frontend button click to displaying results
How does your subject prediction service work internally? (SUBJECT_PREREQUISITES logic)
Explain your feature engineering process for the ML model
What metrics do you track to measure system effectiveness?
How do you handle edge cases (e.g., students who fail multiple times, late bloomers)?


Pro Tips for Presentation:

Have your architecture diagram ready
Prepare a live demo with specific student examples
Know your model metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1)
Have performance benchmarks ready (API response times, prediction speed)
Be ready to show code snippets for key components
Prepare to explain trade-offs you made and why
